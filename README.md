cardiovasculardisease Identification using ibm autoai

Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals based on their demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The model should accurately classify whether a person is at high, medium, or low risk of developing cardiovascular disease within the next 10 years, using a dataset containing relevant features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and any existing medical conditions. The goal is to create a robust and interpretable algorithm that can aid healthcare providers in early intervention and personalized preventive care strategies.
